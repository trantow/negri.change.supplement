# negri.change.supplement
Supplementary material for Journal of Glaciology article titled "Progression of the surge in the Negribreen Glacier System from two years of ICESat-2 measurements" by Thomas Trantow and Ute C. Herzfeld (2024).
## (1) negri.change.suppl.pdf:
A figure file containing a full collection of enlarged ICESat-2 time series plots for all beams and RGTs. This file also contains a summarizing table of the data found in negri_data_2019_2020.xlsx, providing ice-signal fractions and survey lengths over the NEgribreen Glacier System for each RGT beam pass.
## (2) negri_data_2019_2020.xlsx:
A CSV file providing information on the ATL03 granule, acquisition date and run names for each DDA-ice run (one for each beam per pass from 2019-2020), along with the information in Table 1 of  negri.change.suppl.pdf as well. Strong-beam data is found in the first sheet while weak-beam data are found in the second sheet. The third sheet in this file contains the Sentinel-1 granule information for the data used to create the velocity maps in this paper.
